# Language Support

**26 languages parsed to a full AST · 40 on the five-rung ladder ·
framework-aware where an ecosystem handler exists.** "Do you support X" has five useful answers
rather than two, so every language lands on a rung and the rung says what it
buys you. Everything else in your repo still appears in the wiki and is tracked
through git history. This page is the "what works for my language today"
reference.

## Tiers

Every language lands in one tier, and the tier decides which pipeline stages
produce meaningful output.

| Tier | Languages | What you get |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Full** (13) | Python · TypeScript · JavaScript · Svelte · Vue · Java · Kotlin · Go · Rust · C++ · C# · Scala · Ruby | The whole pipeline: AST symbols, import resolution, a resolved call graph, heritage, docstrings, framework edges, **and code-health markers** |
| **Good** (11) | C · Swift · PHP · Dart · Object Pascal · COBOL · GDScript · VB.NET · Elixir · F# · Objective-C | Everything above except the full health suite. Dart and Object Pascal *do* get health markers, and C, F# and Objective-C get the complexity-derived ones; Swift, PHP, COBOL, GDScript, VB.NET and Elixir don't yet. GDScript has a dedicated import resolver and Godot-specific framework edges but no named bindings (see [Known gaps](../architecture/language-support.md#gdscript--godot)) |
| **Partial** (2) | Luau / Roblox · Razor / Blazor | Luau: AST symbols and `require()` resolution (Rojo / `.luaurc` aware), no health markers yet. Razor: a component symbol per file, call edges from `@code` blocks and component tags, C# health markers; no import resolution yet |
| | | ⎯⎯ *tree-sitter parsing stops here. The rungs below are derived from git and imports, not from an AST.* ⎯⎯ |
| **Lightweight** (6) | Clojure · Haskell · Lean 4 · Erlang · HTML · QML | A real file-to-file import graph, no symbol-level claims |
| **Structural** (8) | R · Zig · Julia · Elm · OCaml · Crystal · Nim · D | Git history only: blame, hotspots, co-change. No AST parsing |

The first three rungs are the **26 languages parsed to a full AST**; all five are
the **40** on the ladder. Both numbers are worth stating and neither is worth
stating alone, so if you only take one thing from this page, take the rung your
language sits on rather than either count.

[**SQL / dbt**](#sql--dbt) and [**shell**](#shell) sit outside this ladder on
purpose: each has a coverage shape the tiers cannot describe. SQL is parsed by
sqlglot rather than tree-sitter and gets symbols, wiki pages and health markers
but no call graph, with import edges only inside a dbt project. Shell gets
symbols, `source` edges and function-level complexity, but reachability is
meaningless for a script invoked by name. See
[Beyond code files](#beyond-code-files), along with
[config and data formats](#config-and-data).

## What the pipeline gives each tier

| Stage | Full | Good | Partial | Lightweight | Structural |
|-------|:----:|:----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| File discovery & git history | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AST symbol extraction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| Import resolution | ✅ | ✅ | Luau | file-level | — |
| Call graph edges | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| Heritage (extends / implements) | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Named bindings | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Code-health markers | ✅ | Dart, Pascal | Razor | — | — |
| Dead code detection | ✅ | ✅* | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Semantic search & wiki pages | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Scala's import resolution is partial: it shares the JVM index with Java and
Kotlin and falls back to parsing SBT / Mill build files. Every other Full and
Good language resolves imports outright. On the Partial rung the two languages
split: Luau resolves `require()` and has no health markers, Razor has C#
health markers and no import edges yet.

\* COBOL is excluded from dead-code claims: JCL, schedulers and dynamic program
calls are external entry paths that the repository graph cannot observe.

---

## Why these graphs are different

Plenty of tools will hand you a call graph. Three things separate a graph you
can act on from a picture of arrows. This is the short version; the full story,
with the complete origin table and worked examples, is in
[GRAPH.md](GRAPH.md).

### Every call edge says how it was resolved, and how much to trust it

Most graphs give you an unlabelled arrow. `A calls B`, but was `B` the only
match in the entire repo, or was it right there in the same file? Those are
wildly different claims, and a tool that renders them identically is asking you
to trust its weakest guess as much as its strongest fact.

Every `calls` edge repowise emits carries a **resolution origin** from a closed
vocabulary, and every origin has exactly one confidence:

| Origin | Confidence | What it means |
|--------|:---:|---|
| `same_file` | 0.95 | Defined in the calling file. A certainty |
| `self_scope` | 0.95 | `self` / `this`, a method on the caller's own class |
| `import_scoped` | 0.90 | The name was imported from the file that defines it |
| `receiver_typed_import` | 0.88 | The receiver's type was read off its declaration, then found in an imported file |
| `receiver_global` | 0.75 | The `(class, method)` pair exists *somewhere* in the repo |
| `global_unique` | 0.50 | The name is unique repo-wide. **A guess, and labelled as one** |

That is six of 29. You can filter a graph by confidence, and both
the MCP tools and the web UI surface which origin produced an edge, so an agent
reading an execution flow can tell a fact from an inference instead of treating
both as source.

### A call on a variable resolves by typing the variable

`user.save()` is only a useful edge if something worked out what `user` is. The
naive approach matches `save` against every method named `save` in the repo and
picks one, which is how graphs end up confidently wrong.

repowise instead reads the receiver's **declaration** and resolves the method on
that type. It covers the receiver shapes that actually occur:

- **locals and parameters**: `var repo = new UserRepo()`, `fun f(r: UserRepo)`
- **fields**: a call on `this.repo`, typed from the enclosing class
- **freshly constructed receivers**: `new Foo().bar()`
- **the method's own receiver**: Go's `func (s *Server) handle()`
- **framework-retyped symbols**: `@shared_task def add` makes `add` a `Task`,
  so `add.s()` resolves to `Task::s`

Shipped for **Java, C#, Python, Go, Kotlin and Swift**. Each language was gated
on measured precision before it shipped, and the ones that failed the gate are
recorded as unsupported rather than shipped loose.

### It reports silence instead of guessing

Every capability degrades to *no signal* rather than a wrong one, and each
degradation is deliberate:

- **An execution flow says why it stopped.** A trace that just ends reads the
  same whether execution really ends there or the walker ran out of things it
  could follow. Six terminations are named separately: a real end, a cycle, an
  exhausted hop budget, an all-excluded successor set, a confidence-filtered one,
  and calls that failed to resolve. Where a confidence floor stopped the walk, it
  reports which origins it declined.
- **A `calls` edge means the callee is callable.** Edges pointing at properties,
  constants and modules were withdrawn and re-minted as `references`: "something
  holds a handle to this", which is enough to make deleting it unsafe and not
  enough to claim it is invoked.
- **Framework wiring is its own edge type.** A pytest fixture injection or a
  Spring `@Autowired` field is a `framework_binds` edge, never a `calls` edge.
  Nothing there is a call the parser could have seen, and letting it read as one
  would put an inferred hop into an execution flow as if it were source.
- **An unmapped language produces no findings, not bad ones.** A language reaches
  a health dialect or it stays silent. There is no "best effort" middle.

## Full tier

Complete pipeline coverage: AST parsing, import resolution, call resolution,
named bindings, heritage, docstrings, framework-aware edges, dynamic-hint
extractors and code-health markers.

| Language | Extensions | Import resolution |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Python** | `.py` `.pyi` | Source-root-aware module index (`src/`, monorepo `packages/*/src`, PEP 420), `__init__.py` re-export barrels |
| **TypeScript** | `.ts` `.tsx` | ESM / `require()`, tsconfig path aliases, npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces, `export * from` barrels |
| **JavaScript** | `.js` `.jsx` `.mjs` `.cjs` | `import` / `require()` including CommonJS re-export shapes and member picks |
| **Svelte** | `.svelte` | The TS/JS resolver plus SvelteKit's `$lib` and Node `#`-prefixed subpath imports |
| **Vue** | `.vue` | The TS/JS resolver plus `jsconfig`/`tsconfig` aliases, directory-index components, router `import()` specifiers |
| **Java** | `.java` | `import` / `.*` / `import static` with Maven + Gradle reactor discovery, JPMS, package fan-out |
| **Kotlin** | `.kt` `.kts` | Shares the JVM workspace index with Java, so resolution is cross-language |
| **Go** | `.go` | Multi-module `go.mod` discovery; a package import fans out to every file in the package |
| **Rust** | `.rs` | `use crate::` / `super::` / `self::` with `Cargo.toml` |
| **C++** | `.cpp` `.cc` `.cxx` `.h` `.hpp` `.hxx` `.inl` `.ipp` `.tpp` | `#include` via `compile_commands.json` plus CMake / Bazel header maps, header↔implementation pairing |
| **C#** | `.cs` | `using` / `global using` / aliases via `.csproj` / `.sln`, MSBuild project graph, `partial` class linking |
| **Scala** | `.scala` | The shared JVM index (cross-language with Java/Kotlin), SBT / Mill build parsing as fallback |
| **Ruby** | `.rb` | `require` / `require_relative` with `$LOAD_PATH` probing, Gemfile externals, Rails / Zeitwerk autoloading |

All thirteen also get docstring extraction: Python, Ruby comments, JSDoc,
GoDoc, Rustdoc, Javadoc, Scaladoc, Doxygen and XML doc.

### Framework-aware edges

Routes connect to handlers, DI registrations to implementations, ORM entities to
their relationships:

| Language | Frameworks |
|----------|-----------|
| Python | Django, FastAPI, Flask, Celery, pytest fixtures |
| Ruby | Rails (routes → controller actions, Zeitwerk), RSpec mirror edges |
| Java / Kotlin | Spring (stereotypes, `@RequestMapping`, Spring Data, `@Bean`), Jakarta / JPA, Quarkus, Micronaut, Android manifest |
| C# | ASP.NET (attribute + minimal API), EF Core, gRPC-dotnet, host-builder extensions, CommunityToolkit MVVM |
| Go | net/http, gin, echo, chi, gRPC server registration |
| Rust | Axum, Actix route → handler |
| JS / TS / Svelte | Next.js App Router, Hono / Fastify / Koa / Elysia, Remix / SvelteKit / Astro, tRPC, Express / NestJS |
| C++ | GoogleTest, Catch2, Boost.Test, doctest, Google Benchmark, libFuzzer |

The dead-code analyzer knows each ecosystem's entry points, generated-file
conventions and never-flag globs, so build products and framework-invoked code
are not reported as unreachable.

### Single-file components (Svelte, Vue)

A `.svelte` or `.vue` file is projected into TypeScript at **byte-identical
offsets**, so a component reuses the TypeScript queries, config and all three
health dialects verbatim and every line number points at the real source file.
The component itself becomes a symbol named after the file, `<Foo />` in markup
mints a call edge, and a handler referenced only from `on:click={inc}` or
`@click="inc"` carries an edge instead of reading as dead code.

### Razor / Blazor markup (`.razor`, `.cshtml`)

Razor has the same shape, but with no usable grammar available the locator
byte-scans `@code { }`, `@functions { }` and `@{ }` interiors into a C# buffer
at byte-identical offsets, so the C# queries and health markers apply verbatim
and PascalCase markup tags mint component call edges. It sits on the Partial
rung because `@code` members land as call edges rather than symbols and the
directives are blanked, so a Razor file carries no import edges yet.

---

## Good tier

AST parsing, symbol extraction and static call resolution, plus the
language-appropriate dependency surface. Languages with imports add named
bindings, heritage and a workspace resolver where their syntax supports them.

| Language | Extensions | Dependency resolution |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **C** | `.c` | `#include` via `compile_commands.json` (shares the C++ grammar) |
| **Swift** | `.swift` | SPM `Package.swift` target → directory mapping, intra-module type references, `@main` entry points |
| **PHP** | `.php` | `use Foo\Bar\Baz` with composer.json PSR-4 longest-prefix resolution; Laravel, TYPO3 edges |
| **Dart** | `.dart` | `import` / `export` / `part` URIs, `package:` via every `pubspec.yaml`, Flutter route tables and `runApp()` edges. **Health markers included** |
| **COBOL** | `.cbl` `.cob` `.cobol` `.cpy` | Program IDs, sections, paragraphs and data levels; literal `CALL` and `PERFORM` targets resolve to program/procedure symbols. Dynamic calls and `COPY` edges are deliberately silent |

COBOL is Good rather than Full because it has no code-health walker. Its static
dependency surface is narrower than a module language's: literal program calls
and local procedure transfers resolve, while copybook resolution, dynamic
`CALL data-item`, dialect-specific syntax and source-format preprocessing are
explicitly deferred. Dead-code findings are also suppressed because JCL and
scheduler entry points usually live outside the indexed source graph.
| **Object Pascal** | `.pas` `.pp` `.dpr` `.dpk` `.lpr` `.inc` | `uses` clauses via the generic unit-name → file-stem fallback; project files as entry points. **Health markers included** |
| **GDScript** | `.gd` | `preload(...)` / `load(...)` / `extends "res://..."` resolved as absolute paths from the nearest `project.godot`, so a repo holding many Godot projects keeps each project's `res://` namespace separate, plus scene, autoload and `class_name` edges (see [GDScript / Godot](../architecture/language-support.md#gdscript--godot)) |
| **VB.NET** | `.vb` | `Imports` through the same MSBuild project index C# uses: `.vbproj` / `.sln` parsing, `<RootNamespace>`-aware namespace lookup, NuGet package references |
| **Elixir** | `.ex` `.exs` | `alias` / `import` / `require` / `use` against a `defmodule` index, with the Mix `lib/foo/bar.ex` → `Foo.Bar` convention as the fallback; `alias Foo.{Bar, Baz}` names both modules (no heritage: `use` and `@behaviour` are not inheritance) |
| **F#** | `.fs` `.fsx` `.fsi` | `open` / `open type` against a declared-name index (namespace/module headers), plus the fsproj `<Compile Include>` compile order. `.fsi` signature files contribute imports only, no symbols. A layout that shares one namespace across many single-file projects leaves most `open` targets ambiguous by design, so unused-export findings there sit at the review tier (0.4) rather than being asserted |
| **Objective-C** | `.m` `.mm` `.h` | `#import` / `#include` through the generic header-stem index, which covers the one-class-per-file convention; a framework import names no in-repo file and resolves to nothing |

---

## Beyond code files

### SQL + dbt

Parsed by a dedicated sqlglot handler (multi-dialect, error-tolerant) rather
than tree-sitter.

- **DDL symbols**: `CREATE TABLE` / `VIEW` become class-kind symbols with their
  columns in the signature; `CREATE FUNCTION` / `PROCEDURE` become function-kind
  symbols. Both get wiki pages and `get_symbol` lookups. Set `sql_dialect` in
  config for dialect-specific syntax. Any parse problem degrades the file to
  passthrough, never a crash, never a guess.
- **dbt lineage**: `{{ ref('model') }}` and `{{ source(...) }}` become real
  import edges, so model-level lineage, hotspots, co-change, ownership and
  communities all fall out free.
- **App-to-database contracts** (workspace mode), table *providers* (DDL,
  Alembic, ORM entities) pair with table *consumers* (SQL literals in app code)
  on the Live System Map. See [WORKSPACES.md](../scale/WORKSPACES.md).
- **Health markers**: stored routines get cyclomatic complexity, plus
  `sql_select_star`, `sql_update_delete_without_where` and `sql_cartesian_join`.
  All of them are **uncalibrated by construction** (no defect corpus covers
  procedural SQL), so they surface as findings and never move the defect
  headline score.

SQL is not placed in a tier because it would misreport in both directions:
Partial would understate the health markers, and any higher tier would claim a
call graph and heritage that a DDL file does not have. Outside a dbt project,
`.sql` files get symbols and pages but no import edges at all.

### Shell

`.sh` / `.bash` / `.zsh`. Function definitions become symbols, `source` / `.`
statements become import edges, and calls to functions defined in the same or a
sourced file resolve to call edges; external binaries like `grep` mint nothing.
Resolution covers literal paths plus the common directory-anchor idioms
(`$SCRIPT_DIR/x.sh`, `$(dirname "$0")/x.sh`, `$BATS_ROOT/lib/x.sh`); genuinely
dynamic paths stay external. Shell also gets **function-level complexity**, with
`&&` / `||` command lists counted toward CCN. No class metrics, heritage or
dead-code flagging: shell scripts are invoked by name, so static reachability is
meaningless.

### Lightweight tier

Clojure, Haskell, Lean 4, Erlang and HTML get a real file-level import graph:
imports extracted per language and resolved against a declared module-name
index. The knowledge graph runs in flow/sparse mode on the result: honest
file-to-file dependencies, no symbol-level claims.

**QML** joins the lightweight tier with imports only: module specs resolve
against a `qmldir`-declared module index and quoted references resolve relative
to the importing file. `.qml` files are **never flagged as dead code**, because
a component is instantiated by type name and loaded by the Qt runtime through
qrc, `Loader` and `qmlRegisterType`, none of which is an import.

**HTML** is import-tier on purpose. It has no functions, classes or calls, so
there are no symbols to claim, but its `<script src>` and `<link href>` become
file-level edges, including the one every Vite/webpack SPA depends on:
`index.html` → `src/main.ts`. References resolve as document- or root-relative
asset paths, never as module specifiers, and a tie yields no edge rather than a
guessed one. `.html` files are **never flagged as dead code**: whether a page is
reachable is not statically decidable.

### Config and data

OpenAPI, Protobuf, GraphQL, Dockerfile, Makefile, YAML, JSON, TOML, Terraform and
Markdown appear in the file tree and the wiki, with special handlers extracting
endpoints and targets where applicable.

Godot resource files sit here too: `.tscn` / `.tres` / `.escn`,
`project.godot` and an addon's `plugin.cfg` carry no symbols, but the paths
they name are how a Godot project reaches its scripts, so they are indexed and
read for those paths. See
[GDScript / Godot](../architecture/language-support.md#gdscript--godot).

---

## Code-health coverage

Health markers run off a per-language walker map that is **independent** of
`.scm` parsing: a language can parse perfectly for the graph and still need this
map before markers fire. This table is why a language is Full rather than Good.

| Language | Complexity / nesting | Class metrics | Assertion smells | Mock saturation | Assertion-free test | Extract Method | Performance risk |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Svelte · Vue | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | blocked | blocked | ✅ | ✅ |
| Go | ✅ | n/a | ✅ | blocked | blocked | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | ✅ | ✅ |
| C++ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | ✅ | ✅ |
| C# | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | later | ✅ |
| Kotlin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | blocked | ✅ |
| Scala | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | later | ✅ |
| Ruby | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | later | later | later | ✅ |
| Dart | ✅ | n/a | ✅ | later | later | later | ✅ |
| Object Pascal | ✅ | n/a | later | n/a | n/a | later | n/a |
| Razor | ✅ | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | later | ✅ |
| Shell | ✅ | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

Every cell is a deliberate call, not an oversight: a language reaches a dialect
or it stays silent, and an `n/a` records a metric the language cannot carry
rather than one nobody got to. Kotlin's Extract Method is **blocked on the
grammar**, not unscheduled.

**The assertion count** is the denominator of every test-quality ratio, counted
in two tiers (`analysis/health/asserts/lexicon.py`). The narrow tier is the
`assert` / `expect` prefix match that `large_assertion_block` and
`duplicated_assertion_block` are calibrated on, and it never changes. The broad
tier adds a per-language row plus anything a repository declares in the
`assertions:` block, and feeds the advisory count alone, so a vocabulary edit
cannot move a score. Broad-tier names are matched exactly, never as prefixes:
over three corpora the `check` / `validate` / `approve` / `fail` prefix families
matched ~600 production functions under test and not one assertion.

Counted assertions, narrow tier then both, when the tiers were introduced:

| Corpus | Test files | Narrow | Both |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go, stdlib `t.Errorf` idiom | 502 | 87 | **3,454** |
| Go, testify idiom | 476 | 1,586 | **3,656** |
| TypeScript, should.js present | 521 | 9,956 | **11,165** |
| TypeScript, no should.js | 574 | 15,595 | 15,595 |

Go was effectively invisible. Assertion *runs* were byte-identical in every
corpus, which is what makes the broad tier safe.

**Mock saturation** measures a test's mock setup against its assertions, so it
needs both a mock vocabulary and a trustworthy assertion count. The vocabulary
is one data row per language in
`analysis/health/mocks/lexicon.py`; a language with no row produces no signal at
all.

Because the marker is advisory it ships below the 70% bar, so the line is not
drawn on the precision number alone: **a language ships when its false positives
are the families the marker already declares, and is blocked when its failure is
a different one the marker cannot name.** TypeScript's every false positive was
the known assertion-observes-production-output family. The two blocked languages
fail differently, and for the same underlying reason — the assertion count is the
denominator of every ratio, so a language whose assertions cannot be counted
honestly cannot carry the marker at all:

- **Go** — the assertion half is fixed (table above). What still blocks the
  marker is the other half: no row in `mocks/lexicon.py` and no hand-labelled
  precision figure.
- **Java** — Mockito states a test's real checks as `verify(...)`, which is
  deliberately not an assertion here (counting it would hide the very tests this
  marker looks for). An over-mocked Java test therefore arrives with one vacuous
  `assertDoesNotThrow` as its whole denominator, so the marker misses the tests
  it is for and the ratio peaks instead on large controller tests whose setup is
  irreducible fixture. Measured at 20% precision over 30 hand-labelled findings,
  flat across every threshold tried — but the mechanism above, not that number,
  is why it is blocked. Java now **does** carry a verification vocabulary, added
  for `assertion_free_test`, and it deliberately does not help here: Mockito
  verification is 1,087 calls over those 299 test files, and it reaches
  `verification_count` rather than `assertion_count` precisely so that this
  marker keeps dividing by state assertions alone.

**Assertion-free test** asks whether a test case checks anything at all, so it
needs two things the other markers do not: a per-function "is this a test case"
rule, and an assertion count that misses nothing. The rules live in
`analysis/health/complexity/test_case.py`, one data row per language — a name
prefix for Python, `go test`'s own case-sensitive `TestXxx` rule for Go, the
`it(...)` / `test(...)` callback for JS/TS, and `@Test` and its JUnit siblings
for Java. A language with no row classifies nothing. Go and Java are classified
and counted, which is how their precision below was measured, but the marker
does not report on them — the shipping set is a constant in the detector.

Measured precision, hand-labelled: **51%** on TypeScript (51 findings, the
complete population of two corpora) and **86%** on Python (29 findings, a
systematic sample of 172). The marker ships advisory on both, because the bar
below is a property of the marker rather than of one language, and TypeScript
is at 51%.

Twenty-nine items cannot settle a 70% bar: 86% on that sample carries a 95%
interval of roughly 68% to 96%, whose lower bound sits below the bar it appears
to clear. The reading is consistent with clearing it and does not demonstrate
it. What moved Python is that a test's oracle now reaches it from a function it
calls in the same file, described below. The same change barely moved
TypeScript, for a reason worth recording: a JS/TS suite keeps its helpers in a
separate module, so 19 of its 25 remaining false positives delegate across a
file boundary rather than within one.

An earlier pass published 53% for Python. Re-labelling the pre-change findings
of the same corpus, drawn the same way and read against this pass's rubric,
gives 68.8% (22 of 32), so the gain below is that 68.8 to 86.2 and the 53% is
superseded rather than contradicted. The two passes are not reconciled: 15
points of the difference is labelling, on samples of about thirty, and the
rubric behind the earlier number was not recorded. TypeScript read 52% then and
51% here, which is the evidence that the two rubrics are close and Python's gap
is sample noise rather than a changed standard.

A **mock verification counts as an assertion for this marker and not for the one
above**, which is the deliberate inversion described in CODE_HEALTH.md. It
matters only for Java: Python's `assert_called_once`, jest's
`expect(m).toHaveBeenCalled()` and Go's `t.Error` already reach the narrow tier,
so Mockito is the one dialect where verification is invisible. On a 299-test-file
Java corpus it is 1,087 verifications, and counting them takes the marker from
146 findings to 28 — 118 tests that each had a real oracle — while introducing
none.

Counting a test's oracle turned out to be where the work was. Four forms reached
no tier at all before this. Each was found by reading findings that named an
oracle the counter had not seen, and each is answered at the broad tier so that
no calibrated run moves:

| Form | Example | Why it was missed |
|---|---|---|
| Context-manager oracle | `with pytest.raises(ValueError):` | The call is in the `with` header, not a statement |
| Split call shape | `Helpers.assertRejected(...)` | Java states a call as `object` + `name` and exposes no callee node |
| Property-terminated chain | `expect(x).to.be.null` | chai ends in a property, so the statement is not a call |
| Expression-bodied lambda | `it("x", () => expect(a).toBe(b))` | The body is the expression, so there is no statement to classify |

A private helper (`_assert_no_leak(msg)`) was a fifth: the narrow prefixes anchor
at the start of a name and a leading underscore breaks the anchor.

Firing rate fell as they landed — on a 794-test-file Python corpus from 13.0% of
its test cases to 3.7%, and on a 521-test-file TypeScript corpus from 1.6% to
0.4%. A rate is not a precision measurement; what these five changes are measured
to have done is stop the counter missing an oracle that was written down.

**Go and Java are blocked, and for the same structural reason rather than a
threshold.** Both languages conventionally delegate the oracle to a helper, and
the assertion count is per function, so the helper's assertions are invisible
from the test that calls it:

- **Go** — the idiom is to hand `*testing.T` to a helper that asserts, as in
  `parsertest.RunFileCases(t, ...)`. Measured on the findings themselves: **81 of
  87** on one corpus and **119 of 121** on another pass the test handle to a
  call. That is not a false-positive family a marker can declare and live with,
  it is nearly the whole population, and suppressing on it would leave the marker
  firing a handful of times per repository.
- **Java** — the same shape without the handle, a helper on the test class that
  asserts on the test's behalf. Hand-labelled at **33%** over 18 findings, and 10
  of its 12 false positives were this family.

Separating them needs the assertions of a called function to reach its caller.
Within a single file that now happens. Neither language is unblocked by it: Go
hands `*testing.T` to a package-level helper and Java inherits a base-class
method, and both live in another file, so re-admitting either is a measurement
of its own.

**A called function's assertions reach its caller, inside one file.** The
assertion count is per function, so a test that hands its checks to a helper
beside it read as checking nothing. That was the largest false-positive family
in every language the marker reports on. The walk now records the names each
function calls, and the marker resolves them against same-file functions that
assert. It counts nothing and no calibrated marker reads it.

What it suppresses, by corpus:

| Corpus | Findings | Test cases | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2,012-file Python | 763 to 501 | 17,966 | 4.2% to 2.8% |
| 794-file Python | 194 to 172 | 5,212 | 3.7% to 3.3% |
| 374-file TypeScript | 35 to 33 | 7,354 | 0.5% to 0.4% |
| 562-file TypeScript | 18 to 18 | 4,761 | 0.4% to 0.4% |

Six suppressions were read by hand across the two Python corpora and each is
the declared family: a test whose whole body delegates to a helper that asserts,
or one that parametrises a sibling test by calling it. The resolution matches
names against same-file names and drops the receiver, so a call to an imported
function sharing a local helper's name, or a method on a test-local double
sharing a module-level function's name, suppresses wrongly. Both hide a finding
rather than invent one. No instance turned up in the corpora above, and the
shape is pinned by a test.

What it deliberately does not reach is anything needing the call graph, which
this pass does not consult: `super().test_x(...)`, a package-level Go helper
handed the test handle, and the shared JS/TS fixture module that is most of
TypeScript's remaining error.

**A `.tsx` file is read with the JSX grammar.** It arrives tagged `typescript`,
and the grammar that tag selects fails on the first `<Component />`; everything
after it lands in ERROR recovery. The health pass picks the grammar from the
path instead, in all three places it parses: the complexity walk, the clone
tokenizer and the dataflow CFG. A React suite is read the way a `.ts` suite
always was. What it was costing, measured on two React corpora (374 and 562
`.tsx` files):

| | 374-file corpus | 562-file corpus |
|---|---|---|
| Assertions counted on `.tsx` | 1,367 to 2,085 | 175 to 377 |
| Assertion runs on `.tsx` | 264 to 391 | 30 to 69 |
| `.tsx` files whose clone token stream changed | 365 of 374 | 550 of 562 |
| Function names over 60 chars, a proxy for recovery wreckage | 124 to 0 | 20 to 3 |
| `assertion_free_test` on `.tsx` | 15 to 0 | 0 to 1 |
| Non-`.tsx` files whose walk or token stream moved | 0 of 1,165 | 0 of 1,868 |

Every one of those 15 findings was the grammar rather than the test, which is
why the marker declined `.tsx` files until now. The second corpus's one new
finding is a test that genuinely asserts nothing, hidden by that same rule.

Two calibrated markers read the same walk, and both read it through the
name-keyed `function_metrics`, which keeps one row per distinct function name
and so drops all but one of a file's anonymous `it` callbacks. That key is the
thing to understand here. Recovery had been swallowing whole source spans into
each callback's *name*, and those accidentally unique names were defeating it,
so a `.tsx` file kept rows that a `.ts` file has always lost. Counting names
longer than 60 characters as a proxy for that wreckage: 124 of them on the first
corpus, 0 after. Measured as the share of walked functions that survive the key,
`.tsx` goes from 44.4% to 22.9%, against a `.ts`/`.js` control of 16.0%.

`large_assertion_block` does not move on either corpus (0 and 0, then 1 and 1).
Its floor is fifteen assertions in one run and React cases are short, but the
same name key drops most of the newly visible runs before that floor is ever
consulted, so the floor is not the whole reason.

`duplicated_assertion_block` falls from 304 to 262 on the first corpus, and this
is a loss rather than a correction. Six of the lost findings were read by hand
and every one is a genuine run of consecutive assertions, correctly bounded; the
rows were real and the clone partner was real. What was not real is the
mechanism that kept them visible, which was a mangled name defeating a lossy
key. So `.tsx` files now under-report duplicated assertion blocks exactly as
`.ts` files always have. The corpus carries more real assertion runs after this
change, 264 to 391, and the marker reports fewer of them. Re-keying
`function_metrics` is the fix for that, it moves every calibrated marker at
once, and it is a change of its own.

Svelte and Vue stay `later` rather than following TypeScript: an SFC is walked as
a TypeScript buffer, but a single-file component is essentially never a test
file, so the row would be untestable rather than useful.

The marker is advisory and never deducts. See
[CODE_HEALTH.md](CODE_HEALTH.md).

## Known ceilings

Stated plainly, because a ceiling you know about is worth more than a claim you
cannot check.

- **Template dialects are invisible.** Django/Jinja, Go templates, ERB,
  Handlebars, Blade and Thymeleaf parse as HTML and yield nothing.
- **Svelte and Vue binding forms are skipped.** `{#each x as y}` and
  `v-for="x in xs"` *parse* as JS but mean something else, so they are skipped: a
  parse that succeeds with the wrong meaning is worse than a skip. Component
  props are set by the parent as markup attributes and never imported by name, so
  the unused-export pass is suppressed for both.
- **Object Pascal type kinds collapse.** `record` / `interface` / class-helper /
  enum / type alias all report as `kind="class"`, and its `extends` vs
  `implements` split is inferred from the `I`-prefix naming convention rather
  than guaranteed by the language.
- **COBOL support is intentionally COBOL-85 shaped.** Literal `CALL` and
  `PERFORM` resolve, and `.cpy` files are parsed when indexed directly, but
  `COPY` does not create an edge. Dynamic program names, dialect extensions and
  fixed/free-format preprocessing beyond what the grammar accepts stay silent.
- **Razor has no import edges**, and an attribute-bound handler carries none.
- **Object Pascal's `extends`/`implements` split is a naming heuristic**,
  inferred from the `I`-prefix convention rather than a language guarantee.
- **A GDScript `uid://` resolves through the `.uid` sidecar Godot writes for
  scripts**, so a `preload` naming one reaches its file. A uid naming a scene
  does not: Godot writes no sidecar for `.tscn` / `.tres`, and the
  `[ext_resource]` header carrying such a uid also carries a `path=`, which is
  what resolves. String dispatch is still unresolved, and a script
  without `class_name` gets no class symbol.
- **A Godot `addons/` tree is exempt from dead-code reporting** only when a
  `project.godot` sits above it, so a plugin's own repo reports normally.
- **VB.NET leaves a few constructs unparsed**, XML and tuple literals among them.
- **C has no health dialect.** It shares the C++ grammar for parsing but reaches
  no health walker map, so it gets graph coverage without markers.
- **Scala import resolution is partial**, and ScalaTest's infix DSL
  (`x shouldBe y`) is not counted as an assertion.

Per-language mechanics behind these:
[architecture/language-support.md](../architecture/language-support.md).
