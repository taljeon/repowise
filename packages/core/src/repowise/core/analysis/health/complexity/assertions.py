"""Assertion-block detection (test-quality smells).

Finds runs of ≥2 consecutive assertion statements within a function body,
recorded as ``(start_line, end_line, count)``, and the body's total assertion
count. Opt-in per language via the ``LanguageNodeMap`` ``assert_kinds`` /
``assert_call_kinds`` fields; a language that maps neither produces nothing
(never a false positive). Consumed by the ``large_assertion_block`` /
``duplicated_assertion_block`` biomarkers, and by ``mock_saturated_test``,
which divides mock setup by the total.

Two tiers are counted in one walk, and which marker reads which is the whole
design (``asserts/lexicon.py`` carries the vocabulary and the evidence):

* ``blocks`` counts the **narrow** tier only — an ``assert``/``expect`` callee
  or the language's own ``assert`` statement. The two block markers are
  calibrated on it, so it takes no per-language and no user vocabulary, and a
  broad-only statement breaks a run exactly as a non-assertion always has.
* ``total`` counts the **broad** tier: narrow, plus the language's dialect,
  plus the assertion shapes the narrow tier structurally cannot see (a ``with``
  header, a property-terminated chain, a split call, a private helper). Its
  readers are the advisory ``mock_saturated_test`` and ``assertion_free_test``.
* ``verifications`` counts mock verifications, which are in neither count
  above. ``assertion_free_test`` asks whether a test checks anything, and a
  verification is an oracle, so it counts there; ``mock_saturated_test``
  measures verification itself, so counting it in that marker's denominator
  would blind it. The same call is read two ways on purpose.
