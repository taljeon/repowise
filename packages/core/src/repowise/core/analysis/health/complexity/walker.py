"""Tree-sitter walker → CCN, max nesting, cognitive complexity.

One AST pass per file. For each function/method discovered at the top
level (or nested directly inside a class body / impl block) we recurse
through its body, accumulating:

- **CCN** — McCabe cyclomatic complexity. Start at 1; +1 per branch /
  loop / case / catch / boolean operator.
- **max_nesting** — deepest stack of nesting-contributing nodes within
  the function body.
- **cognitive** — a weighted nesting score: each nesting node
  adds ``1 + current_depth`` (so deeper nesting hurts more); boolean
  operators add a flat +1; jumps (``return``/``break``/``continue``)
  do not contribute (kept simple in v1).

Anonymous functions (lambdas, arrow functions, closures) recurse for
their containing function's metrics when they are nested in a named
function. Module-level lambdas, such as route callbacks, produce their
own ``FunctionComplexity`` row.

This module is the orchestrator: ``walk_file`` parses the source once and
drives the individual passes, each of which lives in its own sibling module:

- ``models``:         the output dataclasses
- ``ast_utils``:      name/text helpers, function-node collection, params
- ``nloc``:           non-blank / non-comment line counting
- ``cyclomatic``:     the CCN / cognitive / nesting engine
- ``assertions``:     assertion blocks + per-function assertion totals
- ``test_case``:      whether a walked function is a test case
- ``mock_walk``:      per-function mock-setup counting (test-quality)
- ``error_handling``: error-handling anti-patterns
- ``perf_walk``:      the performance-risk pass
- ``class_analysis``: class-level LCOM4 / god-class metrics
