class PerfHit:
    """One performance-risk occurrence in a file (the ``performance`` dimension).

    Collected by the walker's whole-tree perf pass (see
    ``_collect_perf_hits``) and lifted into findings by the perf biomarkers.
    Precision-first: every hit is loop-body-scoped and execution-sink-gated so
    an unsupported language / parse failure / builder-only call yields nothing.

    ``kind`` is one of:

    - ``io_in_loop`` — an execution sink at an I/O boundary (db / network /
      filesystem / subprocess) inside a real, data-dependent loop body. The
      boundary kind is carried in ``detail``.
    - ``string_concat_in_loop`` — string accumulation (``+=`` onto a string)
      inside a loop, instead of a buffer / ``join``.
    - ``blocking_sync_in_async`` — a known blocking sync call (``time.sleep`` /
      sync ``requests`` / ``subprocess`` / ``os.system`` / bare ``open``) inside
      an ``async def``, not awaited. ``detail`` carries the offending API.
    - ``resource_construction_in_loop`` — a heavy I/O client / connection
      (``sqlite3.connect`` / ``httpx.Client`` / ``boto3.client`` / ``new
      PrismaClient``) constructed each iteration instead of hoisted.
    - ``lock_in_loop`` — a lock acquired each iteration (``lock.acquire`` /
      ``mu.Lock`` / ``synchronized`` / ``lock(x){}``); a contention signal that
      activates the ``lock`` I/O boundary kind.
    - ``serial_await_in_loop`` — an awaited I/O sink in a loop body (the
      missed-``gather`` / ``Promise.all`` shape). ``detail`` carries the
      boundary kind. Rides alongside ``io_in_loop`` as an advisory co-signal.
    - ``membership_test_against_list_in_loop`` — ``x in big_list`` (or
      ``big_list.includes(x)``) inside a loop where the right operand is a known
      list -> O(n·m); a set would make each probe O(1).

    Phase-7b markers (``func_start``-carrying so the centrality gate can resolve
    the enclosing function to a graph symbol node):

    - ``nested_loop_with_io`` — an I/O sink in the inner body of a nested loop
      (``loop_depth >= 2``) -> O(n·m) round-trips. Rides alongside ``io_in_loop``;
      the nesting itself raises confidence, so it is NOT centrality-gated.
    - ``nested_loop_quadratic`` — a data-dependent loop nested inside another
      (O(n^2) shape). Emitted as a *candidate*; the centrality gate keeps it
      ONLY in a hot/central function (the gate is the precision fix).
    - ``hot_path_sync_io`` — a blocking (non-awaited) I/O sink at ``loop_depth 0``.
      Emitted as a *candidate*; survives only in a top-centrality function.
    - ``blocking_io_under_lock`` — an I/O sink reached while a block-scoped lock
      (C# ``lock``/Java ``synchronized``) is held. Same-function (sink lexically
      under the lock) is emitted here; the cross-function case is added by
      ``perf.gated.collect_blocking_io_under_lock``.

    The Phase-7a markers above are emitted via the dialect ``loop_call_marker`` /
    ``loop_stmt_marker`` hooks (and the inline awaited-sink path for
    ``serial_await_in_loop``), so each is per-language opt-in.

      body that are NOT themselves a direct I/O sink (those are already a
      same-function ``io_in_loop`` hit). Each is a candidate helper whose body
      might reach a sink transitively — the entry points of the reachability
      walk.
    - ``bare_sink_kind`` — the boundary kind of an I/O sink this function
      executes at ``loop_depth 0`` (its own top level, not nested in a loop),

      when a loop in another function calls into it, that sink runs once per
      iteration. The ``loop_depth 0`` requirement is deliberate — a sink the
      function runs inside its own loop is already counted there.
