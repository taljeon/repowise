"""Assertion Free Test: a test case that checks nothing.

A test that runs the code under test and then asserts nothing passes whatever
that code does. It reports coverage, it goes green on a broken build, and it
never fails the refactor it was written to protect. Meszaros names the smell
**Unknown Test**; TestLint and its descendants call it **Assertionless Test**.

It is the one marker in this family that is objectively decidable. The others
ask a question of degree and need a threshold nobody has calibrated; this one
asks whether a count is zero.

**A mock verification counts as an assertion here, and this is deliberately the
opposite of ``mock_saturated_test``.** Zhu et al. (FSE 2025,
doi:10.1145/3715741) measured that mock assertions catch faults state assertions
miss -- 782 of 1,557, at a Jaccard similarity of 32% -- and that verification
concentrates where state assertion is impossible, on external resources, state
mutators and callbacks. So a test whose only oracle is ``verify(...)`` does
check something, and calling it assertion-free would be wrong. The neighbouring
marker measures verification itself and so must exclude it from its denominator.
Same call, opposite treatment, two different questions. The tiers that keep them
apart are in ``complexity/assertions.py``.

**This marker is advisory and never deducts.** See ``ADVISORY_DIMENSION`` in
``scoring.py``, and LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md#code-health-coverage for the measured
per-language precision and the false positives it does not separate.

    """Names of functions in this file that do check something, lowercased.

    A test whose own assertion count is zero has still checked something if it
    handed the job to a helper that asserts, and the count is per function, so
    the helper's assertions are otherwise invisible from the test that calls
    it. That is the largest false-positive family this marker has in every
    language it reports on.

    Names only, and the whole file is one namespace: the receiver is dropped,
    so a helper on one class suppresses a same-named helper on another, and a
    method on a test-local double suppresses against a module-level function of
    that name. Both directions hide a real finding rather than invent one,
    which is the tolerable way round for an advisory marker, but neither is
    free. A helper nested inside the test body is not collected as a function
    at all, so it suppresses nothing.

    Same file only. ``super().test_x(...)``, a package-level Go helper and a
    shared JS fixture all live elsewhere and would need the call graph, which
    this pass does not consult, so those stay false positives.
