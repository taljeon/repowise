"""HealthAnalyzer — thin orchestrator over walker → biomarkers → scorer.

Run sequence per file:

  1. Open the source bytes from ``ParsedFile.file_info.abs_path``.
  2. Walk the AST with ``complexity.walk_file_complexity`` → list of
     ``FunctionComplexity``.
  3. Build a ``FileContext`` (function metrics, git meta, dependents
     count, NLOC, test-file flag).
  4. Run all registered biomarkers via ``biomarkers.detect_all``.
  5. Score the file, attach per-finding impacts.
  6. Side effect: write ``max(ccn)`` into each Symbol's
     ``complexity_estimate`` so downstream consumers benefit.

Repo-level KPIs are computed from the final per-file metrics.

# Bump when a change to this analyzer makes already-persisted health rows wrong
# — a new or removed biomarker, a changed attribution rule, a different finding
# shape. ``repowise update`` compares it against the value stored in state.json
# and re-scores on mismatch (see ``update_cmd.persistence.full_rescore_due``),
# instead of waiting out the 7-day decay timer.
#
# Reach, stated honestly: the gate is only consulted once an update reaches the
# incremental path, so this lands on the next update that has changed files. A
# repo with no new commits returns at the "already up to date" branch and picks
# the correction up on its next commit; workspace members and the hosted
# indexer do not run this path at all. That is the same reach the decay timer
# already has — this extends that trigger rather than adding a wider one.
#
# Deliberately *not* folded into ``config_fingerprint``: that fingerprint means
# "this repo's config content changed", and a workspace update answers drift in
# it by full-re-indexing every member repo. An analyzer change invalidates the
# scores, not the parse or the git index, so it routes to the re-score alone.
#
# Not a licence to move a calibrated scoring weight — those are frozen
# independently of this stamp.
#
# Current stamp: the walker records one new ``FunctionComplexity`` field,
# ``called_names``, which a cached v16 walk does not carry at all. It feeds the
# advisory ``assertion_free_test``, which no longer calls a test assertion-free
# when it handed its checks to a function in the same file that asserts. It
# counts nothing, so no calibrated marker reads it and no score moves.
#
# v16: the health pass reads a ``.tsx`` file with the JSX grammar.
# It arrives tagged ``typescript``, and the grammar that tag selects errors on
# the first ``<Component />``, so a cached v15 walk stored an ERROR-recovered
# tree. Three things stored under it change for ``.tsx`` files and nothing
# else: ``assertion_count`` and ``assertion_blocks`` (assertions after the
# first element were not seen at all), the clone token stream the duplication
# detector hashes, and the dataflow CFG. Function names change too -- recovery
# swallowed whole source spans into the callee name, and those accidentally
# unique names were defeating ``function_metrics``' name key, so the two
# calibrated block markers see a ``.tsx`` file the way they have always seen a
# ``.ts`` one. Non-``.tsx`` files are byte-identical, verified file for file.
#
# v15: ``assertion_free_test`` landed, and the walker records two new
# ``FunctionComplexity`` fields for it (``verification_count``, ``is_test_case``)
# that a cached v14 walk does not carry. It also widens ``assertion_count`` in
# every language that counts assertions at all -- a ``with`` header, a
# property-terminated chain, a lambda body, a private ``_assert*`` helper and
# Java's split call shape all reach the broad tier now -- so the advisory
# ``mock_saturated_test`` divides by a different, larger denominator than a v14
# walk stored. The narrow tier the calibrated block markers read is unchanged,
# verified run-for-run against v14 on four corpora, so no score moves.
#
# v14: the assertion count gained a per-language broad tier, so a Go
# or JS/TS file's ``assertion_count`` changes from what a cached v13 walk stored
# for it. The narrow tier the calibrated block markers read is unchanged, so no
# score moves; this stamp is what re-walks the files whose advisory denominator
# does. Go's row changes no finding until Go also has a mock dialect — it is
# there for the markers that read this count next.
#
# v13: ``mock_saturated_test`` gained a TypeScript / JavaScript
# vocabulary, so a TS or JS file's ``mock_setup_count`` changes from the zero a
# cached v12 walk stored for it.
#
# v12: ``mock_saturated_test`` landed and the walker records two new
# ``FunctionComplexity`` fields, which a cached v11 walk does not carry.
#
# v11: F# and Objective-C gained working complexity node maps and Elixir lost
# its broken one, so stored complexity changes for files in those languages.
#
# v10: non-code files stopped being scored and the deduction was split into its
# structure and history halves, stored per file.
#
# v9: C gained a complexity node map. ``LANGUAGE_NODE_MAPS`` had no
# ``c`` entry, so every C file scored as if it had no branches: ``max_ccn`` and
# the maintainability index were computed off an empty node set and persisted
# that way. The map is present now, so a C file's stored complexity metrics and
# the findings keyed off them change on the next update. C-free repos are
# unaffected; the stamp is what makes a C repo re-score instead of waiting out
# the decay timer.
#
# v8: paired-test detection changed. ``_has_paired_test_file`` had
# ``test_<stem>.py`` hardcoded, so the prefix layout only ever matched Python;
# it now follows the file's own suffix, and ``<stem>_spec`` joins the suffix
# forms. Files that were counted untested and are not become tested, which
# moves untested-hotspot findings and the scores that carry them, on every
# language with a prefix or spec convention rather than Ruby alone.
